# Mastering `.map()` in React

This is a hands-on tutorial for understanding and using the `.map()` method in React. It walks through five different scenarios using simple, readable examples styled with Tailwind CSS. From one-dimensional arrays to nested object structures and conditional rendering, this project helps you get comfortable with mapping data dynamically in your React components.

## What You'll Learn
